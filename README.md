# MI-Lab-E07-REST-Services
This repository contains materials for the MI-Lab exercise that deals with REST services using BAHMNI.

The exercise is available in german (de) and english (en). Refer to the 'Exercise' folder.

## Requirements
A BAHMNI installation is required for the exercise. Instructions can be found at [BAHMNI Wiki](https://bahmni.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/BAH/pages/3117744129/Getting+Started+Quickly+with+Bahmni+on+Docker) and [bahmni-docker github-Repo](https://github.com/Bahmni/bahmni-docker).

In order to carry out the REST calls of the exercise, the [API client bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/) can be used, for example.
For bruno, we provide a ready-to-use collection for import in the 'API-client_bruno' folder.
